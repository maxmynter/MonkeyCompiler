This is a WIP Rust implementation of a [Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) compiler building up on the [interpreter](https://github.com/maxmynter/MonkeyInterpreter) i've built earlier.

The Monkey language was designed by Thorsten Ball for the books [Building an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Building a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/) which I used as reference.
